We are now living in a time of complex distributed systems, where knowing what happens to an application in a certain environment is critical. But where can we obtain useful information about these systems’ development and functioning?

The answer is **Telemetry and Tracing**.

So, let’s begin with what telemetry and tracing are. We will also look into some advantages of both, and how they could be put into place within the industry.

## What is Telemetry?

Telemetry is basically gathering, transmitting, and analyzing data from remote sources. In other contexts, it also refers to collecting information about the performance, health, and behavior of applications. It can be used for system performance monitoring, anomaly detection, and informed decisions on system optimization. The following are the main components of telemetry:

### 1. Data Collection

The gathering of data from various sources, including application logs, system metrics, and user interactions.

### 2. Data Transmission

Transmits the collected data for analysis at a central place.

### 3. Data Analysis

Processing and interpreting the collected data for meaningful insights.

## What is Tracing?

Tracing is a specialized form of telemetry that focuses on tracking the execution of requests or transactions through a distributed system. It provides a detailed view of how requests flow through different components, helping to identify performance bottlenecks, errors, and dependencies. The aspects of tracing include the following:

### 1. Distributed Tracing

Tracking requests as they propagate through multiple services and components.

### 2. Span Analysis

Analyzing individual operations (spans) within a trace to understand their performance characteristics.

### 3. Dependency Analysis

Identifying dependencies between different components and services.

## Key Benefits of Telemetry and Tracing

Needless to say, telemetry and tracing offer a multitude of benefits for organizations of all sizes. By providing valuable insights into application performance, behavior, and health, these tools enable teams to make data-driven decisions and optimize their systems. Let’s discuss some of these benefits in detail:

### 1. Improved performance

With telemetry and tracing, we can pinpoint performance bottlenecks, such as slow database queries or inefficient network calls. By understanding where the system is spending most of its time, we can take targeted action to improve performance.

Telemetry data can inform decisions about resource allocation, ensuring that resources are used efficiently and effectively. For instance, if a particular component is consistently underutilized, it may be possible to reallocate resources to other areas. Likewise, by identifying and addressing latency issues, telemetry and tracing can help improve the user experience and reduce application response times.

### 2. Enhanced Reliability

With telemetry tools, we can continuously monitor system health and detect anomalies before they lead to failures. This proactive approach can help prevent outages and downtime. By identifying issues early on, teams can take corrective action before they escalate into major problems. This can help reduce the impact of incidents and improve overall system reliability.

Since telemetry and tracing also help us identify dependencies between different components and services, we can design more fault-tolerant systems.

### 3. Simplified Troubleshooting

Tracing can help pinpoint the root cause of issues, making troubleshooting more efficient and effective. By understanding the flow of requests through the system, teams can identify the exact location of the problem.

By quickly identifying and resolving issues, telemetry & tracing can help reduce the time to resolution, improving overall system availability. Ultimately, this faster troubleshooting leads to improved customer satisfaction, as users are less likely to experience disruptions or downtime.

### 4. Enhanced Decision-Making

Telemetry and tracing also provide us teams with the data they need to make informed decisions about system maintenance, upgrades, and resource allocation. This way, we can also understand how resources are being used and can optimize their allocation and avoid unnecessary costs. They can help ensure that systems meet or exceed service level agreements (SLAs), improving customer satisfaction and reducing penalties.

## Common Telemetry and Tracing Metrics

Telemetry and tracing involve collecting and analyzing various metrics to gain insights into system performance and behavior. Let’s discuss some of the commonly used metrics.

### Request-Related Metrics

#### 1. Response Time

The total time it takes for a request to be processed and a response returned, includes network latency, processing time, and other factors.

#### 2. Error Rates

The percentage of requests that result in errors or expectations. This metric helps identify issues with application logic, data integrity, or external dependencies.

#### 3. Throughput

The number of requests that can be processed per unit of time. This metric is often used to measure system capacity and performance under load.

#### 4. Latency

The time it takes for a request to travel from one component to another. This metric is particularly important for distributed systems with multiple components.

### Resource-Utilization Metrics

#### 1. CPU Usage

The percentage of CPU capacity that is being utilized by the application. High CPU usage can indicate performance bottlenecks or resource contention.

#### 2. Memory Usage

The amount of memory being consumed by the application. Excessive memory usage can lead to performance degradation or even crashes.

#### 3. Network Usage

The amount of network bandwidth being consumed by the application. High network usage can indicate network congestion or inefficient data transfer.

#### 4. Disk I/O

The amount of disk input/output operations performed by the application. Excessive disk I/O can be a sign of performance bottlenecks, especially for applications that rely heavily on disk-based storage.

### Custom Metrics

#### 1. Business-specific metrics

Metrics that are specific to the application’s domain or business objectives. Examples include sales volume, customer satisfaction ratings, and conversion rates.

#### 2. Custom application metrics

Metrics that are defined and collected within the application itself. This can include metrics related to specific components algorithms, or functionalities.
